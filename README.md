ooobo's fork of nypublicradio's [social-audio tool](https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram).
Fork includes a live theme editor. Working ok (doesn't seem to have any performance impact).
See the [original repo README](https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/blob/master/README.md) for instructions.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the larger the background image filesize, the slower the audiogram will generate. Resize the image before you upload it using the custom background image function! Anecdotally I found that a 860KB PNG would take >11mins to generate, while the 2KB PNG provided took ~1min to generate a 30 second audiogram.
