ooobo's fork of nypublicradio's [social-audio tool](https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram).
Fork includes a live theme editor. Working ok (doesn't seem to have any performance impact).
See the [original repo README](https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram/blob/master/README.md) for instructions.

Next commit will include custom background image upload.
